# AR-Interior-Design-Project
This is AR Interior Design Project, that our team built through Unity game engine. We participated in a hackathon named "Teckhacks 4.0" organized at Chitkara University.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In the realm of interior design, the creative process heavily relies on imagination. However, the practical challenge is of purchasing items that might not integrate in the intended spaces. This mismatch can lead to financial implications and aesthetic compromises. 

SOLUTION:
The solution is to build an Augmented Reality application designed to unleash the creativity making it easier for common man to build their dream spaces.
